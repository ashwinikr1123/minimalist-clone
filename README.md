# minimalist-clone

This project is a replication of the beminimalist.co website, meticulously crafted using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It's designed as a hands-on practice to dive deep into the core functionalities of web development, with a strong emphasis on understanding and implementing event handling, responsiveness, and UI design principles. The goal is to create a visually appealing and functional website, mirroring the minimalist aesthetic and user experience of the original site.
